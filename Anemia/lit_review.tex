\maketitle

The paper most closely related to my own is Block et. al. (2004), who show that financial crisis and drought in indonesia caused increased anemia among mothers and children. Arndt et. al (2016) examine the effects of the 2007-08 food price crisis on height and weight of children in Mozambique. Miller and Urdinola (2010) explore the relationship of coffee bean price and health in Columbia. Ivanic and Martin analyze the effect of the food price crisis 2007-08 across many countries, finding that the adverse effect on net-buyers outweighed the positive effect on net sellers. Ruel et. al. (2010) argue that all poor people are vulnerable to food and fuel price shocks, not just the urban poor.
