\title{Intergenerational Transmission of Anemia: An Outline}

\section{Summary}
I will explore the relationship between infant iron deficiency anemia (anemia) and in-utero food prices. Anemia has a strong inter-generational component. Iron is pass from the mother to the fetus, but cannot be passed through breast-milk. Thus, anemia over the first year is largely determined by maternal iron bio-availability. Female anemia is a major problem around the world, and is a self-reinforcing cycle. \par

World food prices are volatile, more volatile than most other goods. Large increases in world food prices, partly driven by policy and finance in developed countries, have caused discontent and food-insecurity around the world. As agriculture becomes more commercialized, households become more dependent on world markets for food. This has increased the amount of food-security caused by market volatility, while decreasing the effect of local shocks like weather. 
\par

I hope to provide convincing evidence of the inter-generational transmission of anemia, adding another dimension in which maternal nutrition is important. I also hope to highlight a cost of food price volatility.

I will explore the effect of in-utero food prices on infant and childhood anemia. The absolute and relative prices of food determine the bio-avalability of iron in the diet. This iron is passed on to the fetus, and is used to construct the adult hemoglobin. Breast milk cannot be transmitted through iron, meaning that the in-utero period is key. \par
On the left hand side, anemia. On the right, not sure. It could be world or local prices, it could be absolute or relative prices. I think I need to think about my punchline first. It's not just that anemia goes from mother to child. We know that. Why then am I doing this?
\begin{itemize}
	\item	Quantify the effect of world price shocks (the costs of trade)
	\item 	We can then show that the effect is bigger in more remot areas
	\item 	Start to build the infrastructure for Macro fetal-origins paper
\end{itemize}
